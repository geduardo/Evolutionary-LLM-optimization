Here's a JSON object containing a Python solution for the large-scale sorting problem:

{
    "imports": [],
    "code": "def solution(arr):\n    def quicksort(low, high):\n        if low < high:\n            pivot = partition(low, high)\n            quicksort(low, pivot - 1)\n            quicksort(pivot + 1, high)\n    \n    def partition(low, high):\n        pivot = arr[high]\n        i = low - 1\n        for j in range(low, high):\n            if arr[j] <= pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n        return i + 1\n    \n    quicksort(0, len(arr) - 1)\n    return arr",
    "explanation": "This solution implements the QuickSort algorithm, which is known for its efficiency in practice. QuickSort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and performs well on large datasets. The algorithm works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around it, then recursively sorting the sub-arrays. This in-place implementation minimizes memory usage, which is crucial for large arrays. The choice of the last element as the pivot is simple but effective for most cases. For very large arrays, this algorithm provides a good balance between speed and memory efficiency."
