Evolutionary LLM Optimization
## Project Description
The Evolutionary LLM Optimization project aims to leverage the knowledge and capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex optimization tasks using an evolutionary approach. By combining search-based methods, inter-agent communication, and learning, we can effectively navigate the search space and find optimal solutions.
Key Features

Utilizes multiple LLM instances with distinct random seeds to generate diverse solutions
Evaluates and compiles the best solutions based on performance metrics
Generates reports detailing the top solutions and their performance
Reintegrates the insights and learnings into subsequent prompts for iterative optimization
Supports various problem domains that are automatically verifiable and gradable

## Motivation
This project is inspired by the ideas outlined in the post [How Progress Is Made](https://instrumentalcomplexity.com/posts/how-progress-is-made-part-1/), which highlights the importance of combining search-based methods, generally intelligent agents, competition, collaboration, refinement, and tools in driving progress. By applying these concepts to LLMs and evolutionary algorithms, we aim to develop a powerful framework for solving complex optimization tasks efficiently.
